## Lecture Notes
- After Maximato, it was Cardena 
- Because Cardena did not choose b/w radical left and radical right, during the Cold War Mexico was able to stay neutral instead of being pulled to one side or another
- Spnaish America did allow Spainards to racially mix with Native Americans
	- Very different orm America
	- Allowed mestizos
		- This is because Catholicism wanted to spread their religion
- Racial mixing is a big thing
	- Cosmic Race
	- Had a huge chart of racial mixes 
		- I don't understand <-- literal racial class
	- System was embedded with a taxation system
		- Also other favoritisms stuff
- The Cosmic Race 
	- Should've been progressed, was hella racist instead
	- Four basic elements, in Greek Philosopy
