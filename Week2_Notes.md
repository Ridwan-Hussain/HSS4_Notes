# Week 2 Notes

## Last Week Review
- 19th century Mexico
- Two main revolting classes, educated middle class and peasant class
- Aristocracy: Land is a source of power
- Bourgeoisie: Money/Education/Modern Industry is a source of power 
- Church had too much land ownership
	- As a result, Mexico became more secular to undo that land ownership and it went through a lot land reform 
	- **Caciques** indigineous (Native) leaders participated in the revolution because they lost their right to their land as a result of the land reform
		- This is because the **Caciques** was seen as communal, not private ownership
